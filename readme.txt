Supercharge your site speed with AVIF, the world�s most advanced image codec. Enable AVIF uploads, automate compression, and boost your Core Web Vitals instantly.

== Description ==

**AVIF Support by thisismyurl.com** is a lightweight, performance-first utility designed to make your WordPress site faster, leaner, and more modern.

AVIF is the next generation of image compression. Based on the AV1 video codec, it offers significantly better file size reduction than WebP, JPEG, or PNG�often reducing file sizes by up to 50% or more without any noticeable loss in visual quality. Smaller images mean faster load times, improved SEO rankings, and a superior experience for your visitors.

This plugin bridges the gap in WordPress by providing a fully automated workflow for image optimization as soon as you upload them.

### Why AVIF?
